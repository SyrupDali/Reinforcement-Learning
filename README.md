# Reinforcement-Learning
Assignment description: The overall aim of the three assignments of the course is to create a robot that can do groceries by itself. To that end, it is important that your robot can learn how to optimally navigate the supermarket, for example to a product or to the cash register. In this assignment, you will help the robot learn a route based on rewards. The supermarket will be modeled as a maze where the target location yields a positive reward. Your robot will learn to navigate from a fixed starting point to this rewarded target through many rounds of exploration. 
	
For this assignment, we implemented 2 different model-free Reinforcement Learning algorithms: Q-Learning (off-policy) and SARSA (on-policy). Combining with the 3 different exploration strategies we implemented, we analyzed the best set of hyperparameters for this specific task, and we also showed that by modifying the discount factor Î³, we can regulate how much of the reward signal is propagated and manipulate the robot to go to some other terminals.
